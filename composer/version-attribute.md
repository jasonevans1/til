# Composer Version attribute

The composer version attribute declares the version of the package. This is not required. See the snippet below.

```
Optional if the package repository can infer the version from somewhere, such as the VCS tag name in the VCS repository. In that case it is also recommended to omit it.
```

Recommendation is to use the VCS tag instead of the version attribute in the composer.json.
